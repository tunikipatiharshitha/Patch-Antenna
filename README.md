# Patch-Antenna
This project is "Design of an Eight-shaped Patch Antenna using Ansys HFSS"\n
**Software used**\n
Ansys HFSS\n
**Description**\n
It is an Eight-shaped patch antenna, with patch dimensions 20mm x 30mm,with the 
thickness of 1.6mm, using FR-4 epoxy substrate with relative permittivity Îµr=4.4. The 
Eight-shaped patch is modified using a circular slot in the middle and two small 
rectangular slots at the opposite of the patch, which turned into a better result by 
providing the frequencies at 6.5GHz (Wi-Fi), 8.12GHz (C and X bands), 12.1GHz 
(WIMAX). It is used for wireless communications as mentioned above. The simulated 
and measured results are in good agreement.
